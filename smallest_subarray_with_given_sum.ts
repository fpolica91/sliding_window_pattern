/***
  Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘S,’ find the length of the smallest     
  contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to ‘S’. 
  Return 0 if no such subarray exists.

  Example 1:
  Input: [2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 2], S=7 
  Output: 2
  Explanation: The smallest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to '7' is [5, 2].

  what do they want? 
  we are given a list and a number and we need to find the subarray that adds to greater or equal to s
  and find the one that requires the least number of elements, return length.
